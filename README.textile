h1. Shadab's Enki Fork

This is a fork version from git://github.com/xaviershay/enki.git . I have made following changes:
* Blog entries have been moved to /blog scope. Also added a main controller for main pages. This makes it a full feature profile site than just bloggin engine.
* Added a contents table. You can add custom HTML content through admin interface now. E.g. main page uses content with following keys -> main, project1, project2, project3
* Heroku-enable it. It now uses postgres instead of sqllite.
* Added performance and analytics addons like memcacheand and newrelic.
* Added bootstrap theme
* Added disqus comments

Thanks for the the awesome guys at "Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ and "Thomas":https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald for the bootstrap-sass gem.

Feel free to fork it and deploy it. Get some more information on how to use this fork at my "blog":http://shadabahmed.com
