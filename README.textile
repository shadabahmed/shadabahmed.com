h1. Shadab's Enki Modification

This is a fork version from git://github.com/xaviershay/enki.git . I have modified it to heroku-enable it. It now uses postgres instead of sqllite. Also added performance addons like memcacheand newrelic. 

Feel free to fork it and deploy it. Get some more information on how to use this fork at my "blog":http://shadabahmed.com
